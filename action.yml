  Generate credentials to authenticate to Google Cloud from GitHub Actions using
  an OIDC token and Workload Identity Federation.

inputs:
  workload_identity_provider:
    description: |-
      The full identifier of the Workload Identity Provider, including the
      project number, pool name, and provider name. This must be the full
      identifier which includes all parts, for example:
      "projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/my-pool/providers/my-provider".
    required: true
  service_account:
    description: |-
      Email address or unique identifier of the Google Cloud service account for
      which to generate credentials.
    required: true
  audience:
    description: |-
      The value for the audience (aud) parameter in GitHub's generated OIDC
      token. This value defaults to the value of workload_identity_provider,
      which is also the default value Google Cloud expects for the audience
      parameter on the token.
    default: ''
    required: false
  create_credentials_file:
    description: |-
      If true, the action will securely generate a credentials file which can be
      used for authentication via gcloud and Google Cloud SDKs.
    default: false
    required: false
  activate_credentials_file:
    description: |-
      If true and create_credentials_file is also true, this will set the
      GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path to the
      credentials file, which gcloud and Google Cloud SDKs automatically
      consume.
    default: true
    required: false
  token_format:
    description: |-
      Output format for the generated authentication token. For OAuth 2.0 access
      tokens, specify "access_token". For OIDC tokens, specify "id_token". To
      skip token generation, leave this value empty.
    default: ''
    required: false
  delegates:
    description: |-
      List of additional service account emails or unique identities to use for
      impersonation in the chain.
    default: ''
    required: false

  # access token params
  access_token_lifetime:
    description: |-
      Desired lifetime duration of the access token, in seconds. This must be
      specified as the number of seconds with a trailing "s" (e.g. 30s). This is

    required: false

  # id token params
  id_token_audience:
    description: |-
      The audience (aud) for the generated Google Cloud ID Token. This is only
      valid when "token_format" is "id_token".
    default: ''
    required: false
  id_token_include_email:
    description: |-
      Optional parameter of whether to include the service account email in the
      generated token. If true, the token will contain "email" and
      "email_verified" claims. This is only valid when "token_format" is
      "id_token".
    default: false
    required: false

outputs:
  credentials_file_path:
    description: |-
